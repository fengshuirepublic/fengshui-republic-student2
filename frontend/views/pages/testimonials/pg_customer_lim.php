				<h4>Learning Fengshui will allow us to welcome what is auspicious and avoid what is inauspicious, thus increasing our chances of success.</h4>

				<p>The first time I met Master Loh was when was I engaged him for his name changing service. Before this, I have heard about his name from the radio and newspapers; I have also read his articles before. It was out of my expectation that he is actually a very friendly person!After changing my name, my attitude changes to the better, and I become more proactive. I hoped one day I could be Master Loh’s student, so when I got to know Master Loh would be teaching Fengshui courses I immediately seized the opportunity and registered.Master Loh’s way of teaching is very professional; his course content is rich, and he provided a lot of real life examples while explaining everything comprehensively, making the knowledge of Fengshui easily understandable. Whenever I had problems in Fengshui, he would answer my questions patiently. I should mention that I have completed my beginner to advanced Fengshui courses, and I still revise the lessons regularly with other course mates. I believe that if one is born rich, that does not mean he or she will become successful; and if a person is born poor that does not mean the person will always be in failure. Learning Fengshui will allow us to welcome what is auspicious and avoid what is inauspicious, thus increasing our chances of success. The reason that I take Bazi courses from Fengshui Republic is to understand how I should plan my life, for without a clear mind we might be lost and without carefulness we might fall. And I should say that Fengshui Republic’s team is not only professional, they are friendly too, and we are now all good friends!</p>

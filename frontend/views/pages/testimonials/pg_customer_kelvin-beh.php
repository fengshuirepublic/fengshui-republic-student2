				<h4>I have learned genuine Fengshui and applied it in my daily life and in my business; it is no wonder that I am satisfied with my life now.</h4>

				<p>I still remember that all happened in 2011, a week before Chinese New Year. That morning I accompanied my mom to the market to buy stuffs for the New Year. Passing through the newsstands, I discovered Master Loh’s Year Book among other books and magazines about the Year of Rabbit. After browsing through the book, I was attracted by its rich content and bought it back home. After reaching home, I found out the content of the book is easy to understand and I had learned the knowledge on the yearly Chinese animal signs and household Fengshui arrangements. In April 2011, I got to know Master Loh would have a Fengshui convention in KL-Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall through a friend’s Facebook. After checking the date and time, I was enthusiastic to drive 3 hours from Ipoh to KL to support Master Loh’s convention.After attending this Fengshui convention, I agree with the basics and the knowledge on Fengshui shared by Master Loh, and I develop strong interest in Fengshui, so I registered for Master Loh’s professional Fengshui courses during the convention, and under his guidance and practices, I have completed beginner, intermediate and advanced Fengshui courses, which benefited me a lot. It is fated that I get to know Master Loh, and he has guided me in my problems in Fengshui and in my life. Through him, I have learned genuine Fengshui and applied it in my daily life and in my business; it is no wonder that I am satisfied with my life now. I also frequently recommend Fengshui Republic and its authentic, professional services to friends and family. In just a few years, Fengshui Republic has expended its team, and its services just get better and better. I hope Fengshui Republic will continue to promote Fengshui and Chinese metaphysics. Thank you Master Loh and Fengshui Republic team!</p>

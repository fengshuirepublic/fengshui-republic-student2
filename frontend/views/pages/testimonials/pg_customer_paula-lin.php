				<p>I do not consider myself as a superstitious person, but I would say that Fengshui plays an important role in my life. A magician might be able to do what he wants for a short period of time and he or she can make the impossible possible, while a Fengshui Master can make permanent changes in your life to make it better. I first learned about Fengshui when I was in secondary school. Throughout the journey of my life, I have met incredible people, escaped from death and married to my Mr. Right. From these incidents, I had seen the mysteries and power of Fengshui.After my husband and I completed our wedding, we started to build our own small family. I contacted Fengshui Republic to get its Fengshui services for our new house. When I first met Master Loh and his team, I was astounded to meet my secondary school mate! And this actually facilitate our communication.</p>
				<p>What Fengshui Republic’s team impressed me the most is that they would not ask me to buy overpriced Fengshui items, and they even prepared some simple items for us. What’s more, other than being professional Fengshui consultants they are also interior designers; this really touches our heart, and we admire the professionalism of Master Loh and his team. After conducting the Fengshui survey, the team provided me a copy of our very own Fengsui report and explained to us everything in details. Before moving in, my ex-schoolmate Master <b>Melvin</b> gave us a copy of moving-in details as well, and again he gave us clear explanations. All of us can feel the hard work and effort of After moving to our new house, we live a happy, harmonious life, and a year later we were blessed with a baby, born in the Year of Horse. Without hesitation, we engaged Fengshui Republic for the baby naming service. Our child now is healthy and smart, and that is the greatest blessing for parents like us. Though in these few years, we have not become extremely rich, our economic condition sees clear improvement. Fengshui greatly influences our life even without us knowing it. In the future, we will continue to engage Fengshui Republic for their services again. If we are blessed with another child, his or her name will be given by Master Loh as well. Professionalism in Fengshui requires great knowledge and experience, and it is important to have sincere attitude too. All these good qualities can be found in Fengshui Republic. Thank you!</p>

				<h4>Fengshui Republic is a trustworthy choice; its professionalism and positive attitude has provided us truly one-stop, comprehensive Fengshui services.</h4>
				<h6 class="mb-4">Client：Adam Ang</h6>
				<p>My family’s relationship with Fengshui Republic started when I engaged the company’s baby naming service for my daughter. When choosing a name for a child, we should choose one that sounds elegant, at the same time compatible with the baby’s Bazi to improve her fortune. We are impressed by Fengshui Republic team’s professionalism and good customer service, and as parents we feel very satisfied. The team had considered several factors in naming, and gave us several options to  choose from, and that name would be the first and the most everlasting gift we give to our baby. As Master Loh had said, the first impression we give to others is our name; a good name will not only improve our luck, but also will also leave a good impression on other people. This is how we get connected to Fengshui Republic. Our next connection is through household Fengshui. Concerning household Fengshui, I love the logical arrangement of Fengshui Republic, as the arrangement is compatible with the auspicious direction of the house while retaining the practical aspects, unlike some Fengshui Master who required us to blindly follow laborious renovations. I was also surprised that the team specially provided us some safe, constructive arrangements and advices for our child. Now that is complete Fengshui service! Again, we are amazed by Fengshui Republic, and my husband even decided to become a student of Fengshui Republic. I fully support my husband’s decision, as learning a field of knowledge should be encouraged. It is a pity that my husband’s siblings thought we are dabbling in some sort of charlatanism. Unable to convince them, my husband felt dejected and asked why do I believe in him and support him. My reply was, “because I am superstitious too”, and that made him speechless! But actually, Fengshui is logical and scientific.</p>
				<p>Fengshui Republic shows us that Fengshui is actually scientific environmental knowledge, and it is a branch of proven learning passed down by the ancient people, not some sort of hocus-pocus. Fengshui cannot change our fate, but it does definitely provide positive energy for your career, household and individual fortune. With this positive energy, things will go smoothly and we will enjoy greater chances of success. This positive energy is what we need and what we should have. I would like to emphasize that we are not blindly superstitious, but we believe that Fengshui is scientific and not as esoteric as some believe. Of course, some Fengshui service providers do make it seem to be superstitious, but those who have tried Fengshui Republic’s services will know this company is a trustworthy choice; its professionalism and positive attitude has provided us truly one-stop, comprehensive Fengshui services.</p>

				<p>Few years ago, I became very interested in Chinese metaphysics, yet it was hard to look for authentic metaphysical course. By chance, I found Master Loh’s Facebook page, and while browsing through his page, I absorbed a lot of information related to Fengshui and physiognomy. After that, I started to feel that physiognomy is useful too. It is said that our mind affects how we look, and I think this knowledge will be of great use for my business and sales in the future.I was excited when I got to know that Master Loh would start his physiognomy course. So, after consideration, I flew from Penang to KL to attend this physiognomy course.In the beginning, I was afraid that the course content would be too deep for me, and that it would be too boring and difficult. To my surprise, the class was conducted in fun and interesting way. Master Loh’s classes were lively, and he had good interactions with us; even the students had good interactions with each other, and discussed about each other’s physiognomy, so the class had good learning environment.After we graduated, Master Loh’s team specially created a chat group for us to continue discussing and interacting. Through continuous revisions, now I would take note of the facial features of the people I meet to understand their characteristics. I hope I will have the chances to learn other fields of knowledge, like Fengshui and Bazi from Master Loh.I would like to recommend everyone who is interested in Chinese metaphysics to join Master Loh’s courses; I can guarantee that you will learn a lot. Thanks to Master Loh and the team for your efforts.</p>

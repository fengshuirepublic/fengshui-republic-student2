				<h4>Fengshui Republic’s life-long learning system allows me to revise all Fengshui and Bazi courses without paying anything extra</h4>

				<p>First of all, congratulations to Master Loh for the 10th anniversary of Fengshui Republic, and I wish to thank the entire team for their good services. I would also like to thank selfless teachers like Master Chen Yiqian of the Bazi courses and the experienced Fengshui consultant Master <b>Melvin Wong</b>. I often see people commenting on Master Loh’s Facebook that they always miss the chances to take part in Fengshui courses, and I am thankful to Fengshui Republic that I am able to take the Advanced Tomb Fengshui course.In <b>2014</b>, Fengshui Republic was awarded with the international ISO certification, and it is the only systematic, reputable and renowned Fengshui company in Malaysia. This also proves that I have chosen the correct institute. In every class, Master Loh would feel concerned that some students might not understand what he teaches, so he repeatedly asks the students questions and presents the lessons in humorous ways to let the students understand the lessons well. Master Chen Yiqian is the teacher for the Traditional Ziping Bazi course; he is often seen smiling and is known to be a gentle person. He patiently explains all the details and he often teaches the students to forecast the fortune using traditional method to build a solid foundation.After watching Master Loh’s Fengshui program on <b>NTV7</b> in <b>2010</b>, I developed an interest in Fengshui and I was excited to know about the Fengshui courses through Master Loh’s Facebook in <b>2014</b>. After attending Master Loh’s trial Fengshui lesson, I got to know Fengshui better, but unfortunately due to my job I was unable to join the <b>2014</b> Fengshui courses.Finally, in <b>2015</b> I was able to attend the Beginner Fengshui lesson, and I continued until the advanced level. Because of my working schedule I could not make it to KL’s Advanced Fengshui course, but determined to attend the Advanced Tomb Fengshui course, so I went all the way from KL to the unfamiliar Johor Bahru to revise the Advanced Fengshui lessons, and I was happy to get to know the students from JB. In the end, I was able to attend the Advanced Tomb Fengshui course, and I am thankful that Master Loh brought us to Nirvana Memorial Park for our field trip to inspect the influence of the earth formation on tomb Fengshui, giving us deeper understanding on the subject matter.This year, I was happy to be a volunteer worker for Master Loh’s <b>2016</b> Fengshui Convention. After Chinese New Year, Fengshui Republic’s life-long learning system allows me to revise all Fengshui and Bazi courses without paying anything extra, and I am able to learn and understand all courses this way.This July, I was still hesitating if I should join the physiognomy course as I did not have much interest in this subject, but many friends and family members encouraged me to enroll in the course, so I did. After attending the course, I learned a lot of profound things, and able to tell basic characteristics of a person through facial feature, and this is helpful in my interpersonal relationship.</p>

				<h4>It is in this house after conducting the Fengshui survey our child grew up healthily and happily, and that our family lives harmoniously.</h4>

				<p>I would say Master Loh and his team provide the best services and it is their services that make happiness possible in my life. I have an energetic and smart son, and he was born through Caesarean-section in the auspicious day and hour carefully chosen by Master Loh. Some might consider Caesarean-section as unnatural, and I had the same doubt too. However, Master Loh explained that regardless how auspicious a day is, the baby needs to have enough good fortune to be born on that day, for instance there could be incidents like the doctor might not be free on that particular day, or the doctor was late for the surgery, or there might even be some problems in the surgery room, causing the baby not be able to be born in the selected day and hour. I fully agree with Master Loh’s explanations. Caesarean-section requires heavenly, earthly and human factors too. After the baby was born, based on the Bazi, Master Loh efficiently selected a number of suitable names for him, and I chose the one I like the most. My son was easy to take care of when he was still a baby, and during that time he was a chubby little darling; now he is a dashing little prince.</p>
				<p>Having a new member in the household means that we would need more space for the child to move freely and comfortably, so we searched for a more suitable place to stay. I contacted Master Loh’s team for their services again. After choosing the location, Master Loh came to the construction site to choose an auspicious direction for us. I still remember that he dressed in all white that day, like a prince charming. He did not mind setting his feet on the mud, and made his shoes dirty at all; all he cared was choosing the right direction for us. Perhaps some might ask why should we choose the direction of our house? Well, choosing the right direction would make life easier for us, and we do not need to spend more money to renovate the house to suit the direction; that is a little investment for a greater return.</p>
				<p>After the house was built, it was the time for designing the interior of the house. I did not engage with any interior designer at all, instead my top-quality interior designer is Master Loh himself. Since when did Master Loh become a designer? Well, Master Loh is not just a Fengshui Master, when it comes to Fengshui decoration, he is knowledgeable in designing too, like choosing the right wallpaper, placing the screens in the right direction, the suitable materials, which color to choose for lamp decoration and others; he is more skillful than many interior designers! It is in this house that we see our child grew up healthily and happily, and that our family lives harmoniously.</p>

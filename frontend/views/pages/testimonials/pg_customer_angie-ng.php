				<h6 class="mb-4">Client：Angie Ng</h6>
				<p>First of all, I wish Master Louis Loh’s Fengshui Republic a happy 10th anniversary!</p>
				<p>Initially, I remained doubtful on Fengshui, and it was only until problems occurred in my career and in my family’s health that I started to get to know more about Fengshui.The first Fengshui Master I met was probably not skillful enough, and the result I got was not satisfactory. A few years later, I bought a new house and I intended to find a reliable Fengshui Master. After inquiring a number of well-known local Fengshui Masters, to myall of them charge exorbitant fee, were arrogant and unapproachable.</p>
				<p>As I was about to give up, I was fortunate to see Master Loh’s show on NTV7. While still having doubts in my mind,decided to try my luck. Then, I found out Master Loh has an office in Taman Molek, Johor Bahru. After making appointment through a phone call, I went to the office. The first person I met was Master Melvin, who is already famous now. Back then, he was Master Loh’s assistant, and his success proves that Master Loh is a great instructor. The design of the office is quite cozy; I guess Master Loh must had spent a lot of effort in the Fengshui of this place, so I was convinced easily. After some inquiries, I found out Master Loh’s services are high quality, high standard and trustworthy. Best of all, his charges are affordable! And I have chosen these services provided by Fengshui Republic:</p>

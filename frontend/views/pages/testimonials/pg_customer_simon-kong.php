				<h4>The Basic, Beginner Level Fengshui Course Taught By Master Loh Is At The Same Level As That Fengshui Master’s Knowledge.</h4>
				<h6 class="mb-4">Client：Simon Kong</h6>
				<p>As I started my working life, I get to know some important people. Because of my job, I often see these successful people like managing director of some big conglomerates and visited their houses and offices, and sometimes I would see some antiques; and I discovered that these antiques are actually related to Fengshui. When I chatted with them, they often talked about how powerful Fengshui is. Because of this, I became interested in Fengshui.At the end of the year before last year, I saw Master Loh posted about Fengshui courses on his Facebook. I have been a fan of Master Loh, as he often presents knowledge in Fengshui in comprehensive and informative way. I was still hesitating if I should join the courses, so I only subscribed to the Fengshui magazine published by Master Loh. Last year, I moved to a new house and a friend introduced me a Fengshui Master from China who charged me about RM1000 for the Fengshui inspection. I was doubtful on the Fengshui Master and at that time I remember Master Loh’s Fengshui courses. After getting know the cost, I bought my flight ticket from Miri to KL to After taking the basic course, I found out what I learned is exactly what the Fengshui Master from China knows. The basic, beginner level Fengshui course taught by Master Loh is at the same level as that Fengshui master’s knowledge, and that makes me wonder how do these Fengshui masters even dare to provide Fengshui services. After completing the Fengshui beginner and intermediate courses, I rearranged my house according to Fengshui’s principles, and the second day after moving in I gained some money, and that is really incredible. After finishing my classes, my friends and family all called me “Master”, and that is really embarrassing, though I do practice what I learned and do Fengshui inspection for them when I am free.</p>

				<h4>My company expand so rapidly, and I am able to enjoy a comfortable house and working place too!</h4>
				<h6 class="mb-4">Client：Sun Low</h6>
				<p>In <b>2012</b>, I had saved enough money to buy a piece of land to build a factory, then during that time, a friend introduced Master Loh to me. My friend told me that since I had paid the money for the land, why not spent a bit more for Fengshui advice? In the end, it was Master Melvin, a disciple of Master Loh who visited us. I was a bit disappointed but since I didn’t really care about Fengshui, it was no big deal to me. However, once I saw Master Melvin, I changed my mind. Master Melvin explained that Fengshui is logical and has a strong basis, and this was quite eye-opening for me. As I strongly believe in logics, I believe in the Fengshui taught by Master Loh. In <b>2014</b>, I bought a new house and the first person I could think of is Master Melvin. All house-moving ceremonies were explained clearly; <b>John</b> was kind to give me his opinions, as well as selected an auspicious date for me even without charging me. I feel thankful for that and because of you guys, my could expand so rapidly, and I am able to enjoy a comfortable house and working place too!</p>

				<h4>I had made some Fengshui arrangement for my own house as well; it would not take long for me to feel its effects</h4>
				<h6 class="mb-4">Client：叶礼安</h6>
				<p>I have been enthusiastic in Fengshui ever since I was small, and throughout all these years I love to search for books related to Fengshui. One day, I came across an article on the theory of Fengshui written by Master Louis Loh in a celebrity magazine, and I deeply felt that Master Loh’s explanation was logical and scientific, and I wished to learn from such Fengshui Master. So, I joined Master Loh’s Fengshui Convention, and later I enrolled in his Fengshui courses. During the beginner’s course, Master Loh’s teaching method had made me become even more interested in Fengshui, so I decided to join the intermediate course, and I had made some Fengshui arrangementfor my own house as well; it would not take long for me to feel its effects. Since then, I become confident and happy that I have found a good teacher. I finished the advanced course, and learned a lot of valuable knowledge under the guidance of Master Loh. I feel grateful for the selfless teachings of Master Loh, as well as for the helpfulness of Fengshui Republic team. Thanks to Master Loh and Fengshui Republic team, and I wish Master Loh and Fengshui Republic a prosperous, fortunate 10th year anniversary.</p>

				<h4>Professional and impressive.</h4>

				<p>The first time I saw Master Loh was in 2013 in a TV show about the year of Snake. That time, he appeared in a Chinese New Year program about Fengshui. I thought, “hey, this Fengshui Master looks so young, he doesn’t seem to be that experienced. I guess he just spent some money to appear on TV for the sake of promoting himself!” Afterwards, I did not pay much attention on Master Loh.</p>
				<p>It was until in 2014 during Chinese New Year eve, a friend gave me a few tickets for Master Loh’s Fengshui Convention, and I finally recalled this young Fengshui Master. So I thought this was a good chance to see if the young Fengshui Master, who was already quite well-known was really knowledgeable. I witnessed the true charisma of Master Loh in that convention. Though still young, Master Loh is indeed very knowledgeable in Fengshui. During the convention, Master Loh explained the yearly Fengshui, 12 animal signs and physiognomy in humorous and entertaining way, and we all enjoyed ourselves listening to his talk. It was also through the convention that I got to know Master Loh is also conducting Fengshui classes. Without hesitation, I enrolled in his Fengshui course. I have been interested in Fengshui and Chinese metaphysics since young, and I have collected a number of books in these topics yet I understand very little about the content of these books. I wanted to look for a teacher, but I did not know which teacher would be qualified. That is until I met Master Loh, I knew that he is the Fengshui teacher I had been looking for.</p>
				<p>In 2015, I had my first Fengshui class at Fengshui Republic, and was attracted by the design and decorations of Fengshui Republic’s office. The Chinese-style furniture balances well with modern decorations, making the place looks quite cozy and homely. The design, which combines both Western and Chinese elements, actually contains Fengshui secrets specially arranged by Master Loh. It was only after I took the course that I found out Fengshui arrangement does not require a lot of those so-called lucky Fengshui objects. Real Fengshui arrangements need to consider both auspicious directions and landscape, and true Fengshui Master’s arrangement will not reveal this secret easily. In the class room, Master Loh explained his lessons in entertaining way, so that we were able to understand the teachings very fast. Many of my unanswered questions when I read those Fengshui books throughout the years were finally answered. Most importantly, Master Loh has travelled to a lot of places and learned the lore of different Fengshui schools yet he will never subscribe to only one single school and criticize other traditions. Instead, he gathered the essence of all different schools and taught us to utilize different methods from different schools in different situations, and these different methods can even be used for the same house. No one single Fengshui school is more superior to another; but a real adept can adapt to different skills from different schools. To use a metaphor, different schools of Fengshui are like different medicines for different illnesses, and a Master who knows how do use these different medicines is indeed a veritable master. Master Loh presented his lessons in comprehensive, easily to understand method, which benefited me a lot. Other than theoretical knowledge in the classroom, Master Loh also brought the students outside of the classroom for practical session to allow us understand better the theories we learned. Other than Fengshui course, I also attended Master James Lai’s Blind School Bazi course. When I first heard of Blind School Bazi, I thought it was a new, weird name for gimmick purpose because the only Bazi system I knew was Ziping School’s. When I saw Master James Lai invited people joining his course by posting “Don’t understand traditional Ziping Bazi? Try Blind School Bazi!”. I immediately made a phone call to Fengshui Republic to register for the course. And that is how I became the first student in the Blind School Bazi’s beginner class. After attending the classes, I discovered that instead of being a new Bazi system, Blind School is a very ancient one, it is just that very few people know about and teach this Other than that, Fengshui Republic also has a very professional team, and if I have any questions in Fengshui, I will just need to make a phone-call and the team members will answer my questions in detailed. That is quite professional and impressive. I would also like to use this opportunity to wish Fengshui Republic a happy 10th anniversary. May the business of Fengshui Republic get better and better!</p>
